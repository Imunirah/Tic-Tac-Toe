### Plan:


Winter is the coldest time of the year.  The days are shorter and the nights are longer and often families spend their time on indoor areas and enjoying doing some different activities. As a developer, I thought is very important to create a traditional fun game that depends on the challenge between players, I decided to create a Tic-Tac-Toe game winter version that helps families to enjoy their time in winter, on the other hand; I can improve my skills in Html, Css and Javascript.

### Tic-Tac-Toe plan:
- I have analyses project requirements then make a working plan for more details please check the attachment file "Tic-Tac-Toe plan.xmind ".
- Html part has one main div that includes one class called "first" this div includes three divs with class name " title, bg,
the game", "game" class  include three divs called row. Also it is cove heads, body and button.
- JavaScript part has an append function that allows adding X and O, click funcation for player move and Checkwinner function that compares all scores then show the winner.
- Css part changes all styles/layout of the page.
